# Unique Characters

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
can not use additional data structures?

For example for the input `"olly"`

```text
False
```

For example for the input `"asdfg"`

```text
True
```

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the README.md file
