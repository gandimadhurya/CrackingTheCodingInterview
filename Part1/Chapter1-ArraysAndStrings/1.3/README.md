# Remove Duplicates

Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string
without using any additional buffer.
 
NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine.
An extra copy of the array is not.

Write the test cases for this method.

For example for the input `"abcd"`

```text

```

For example for the input `"Hortons"`

```text
Hortns
```
